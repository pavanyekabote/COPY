# **Copy**

#### Thought and path for its creation
   One day I was sitting idle and was thinking to build a Messaging application using java. So, I started working on it. Soon the project was completed, I was excited, then friends in my room did lots of texting ;) though it was a Desktop based CLI application.
   
   My brain one day suddenly signalled me ***Why not upgrade this simple messaging application to be capable of transfering files between two nodes..!End of day, File is also data.*** Then I started to learn Networking concepts of java and upgraded its capabilities to transfer files too. 
   
##### This was my happy journey of developing this COPY Project.

## How to run ?

#### If You are a Sender :
1. Run **py.serv.PYShare.java** file from your main function.
2. Program Waits until client is connected to your IP address.
3. A GUI frame will popup by which you can select the file to be transferred.
4. That's It.

#### If You are a Receiver :
1. Run **py.client.PYShare.java** file from your main function 
2. Enter Server/Sender IpAddress
3. Once connected the file will be automatically received if sender initates the transfer.
4. Saves the file in desired location
5. That's it.
